The vehicles package defines the class hierarchy for all vehicle types in the system. It includes a base Vehicle class with common attributes like make, model, year, and plate number, and subclasses 
such as Car, Truck, GasolineCar, ElectricCar, DieselTruck, and ElectricTruck, each adding specific features like passenger count, fuel tank, or range. This package uses inheritance and polymorphism to 
model real-world vehicle behavior while managing unique identifiers for each type.
